# Doppler
Doppler - is an open source messenger, created for entertainment purpose, but can be used as open-source custom hosted messenger (If you really need it ;)

The most interesting thing about this project - it has been written completely in .NET C# (Okay, I have also used some JS for a few web site features, but they also can be replaced by some ASP.NET MVC features)
