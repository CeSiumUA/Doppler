# Doppler
Doppler - is an open source messenger, created for entertainment purpose, but can be used as open-source custom hosted messenger (If you really need it ;)

The most interesting thing about this project - it has been written completely in .NET C# (Okay, I have also used some JS for a few web site features, but they also can be replaced by some ASP.NET MVC features)

Upd 03/10/2021: I need to write the web part on Angular firstly, but an idea to write all the things using C# is still alive, and I'll really do that! Yeah, it will be 2 Web sites for same things, one on Agnular, one on Blazor...
